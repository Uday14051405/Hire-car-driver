# Hire-car-driver
We collaborated as a team of three at Weblord Infotech Pvt. Ltd. during our internship to develop a comprehensive project titled 'Hire Car Driver'. This dynamic website, crafted using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, offers a seamless platform for users to hire car drivers. Our endeavor involved capturing detailed information from both drivers and clients, ensuring a tailored service experience. Additionally, we incorporated an intuitive app design using Figma to enhance user interaction. Our collaborative effort resulted in a dynamic and user-friendly platform that streamlines the process of hiring car drivers while honing our skills in web development and project management.
